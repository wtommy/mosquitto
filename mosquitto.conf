# Config file for mosquitto
#
# This isn't a stable file format.
# Ultimately it should probably mirror the format used by rsmb.
#
# Default values are shown, uncomment to change.

# Network interface to bind to, e.g. eth0
# Optionally specify a port number if not using the default 1883.
# For example "interface eth0:1834"
#interface

# Port to bind to.
# This option may be repeated to make mosquitto listen on multiple ports.
#port 1883

# Time in seconds to wait before resending an outgoing QoS=1 or QoS=2 message.
#retry_interval 20

# Time in seconds between updates of the $SYS tree.
#sys_interval 10

# Write process id to a file. Default is a blank string which means a pid file
# shouldn't be written.
#pid_file

# When run as root, drop privileges to this user and its primary group.
# Leave blank to stay as root, but this is not recommended.
# If run as a non-root user, this setting has no effect.
#user mosquitto

# ======================================================================
# Persistence
# ======================================================================

# If persistence is enabled, save the in-memory database to disk every 
# autosave_interval seconds. If set to 0, the persistence database will 
# only be written when mosquitto exists.
# Note that writing of the persistence database can be forced by sending
# mosquitto a SIGUSR1 signal.
#autosave_interval 1800

# Save persistent message data to disk (1/0).
# This saves information about all messages, including subscriptions,
# currently in-flight messages and retained messages.
#persistence 0

# Location for persistent database. Must include trailing /
# Default is an empty string (current directory).
# Set to /var/lib/mosquitto/ if running as a proper service.
#persistence_location

# ======================================================================
# Logging
# ======================================================================

# Places to log to. Use multiple log_dest lines for multiple logging
# destinations.
# Possible destinations are: stdout stderr syslog topic
# stdout and stderr log to the console on the named output.
# syslog uses the userspace syslog facility which usually ends up in
# /var/log/messages or similar.
# topic logs to the broker topic '$SYS/broker/log/<severity>', where severity
# is one of D, E, W, N, I which are debug, error, warning, notice and
# information.
# Use "log_dest none" if you wish to disable logging.
#log_dest stderr

# Types of messages to log. Use multiple log_type lines for logging
# multiple types of messages.
# Possible types are: debug, error, warning, notice, information, none.
# Note that debug type messages are for decoding the incoming network packets.
# They are not logged in syslog.
#log_type error
#log_type warning
#log_type notice
#log_type information

# ======================================================================
# Extensions
# ======================================================================

# Path to sqlite regex extension. Note that mosquitto will fail to start if
# this cannot be loaded.
# If the extension at this path cannot be loaded, a fall back option of
# /usr/lib/sqlite3-pcre.so will be used.
# Default on Windows/Cygwin:
#ext_sqlite_regex ./sqlite3-pcre.dll
# Default on other platforms:
#ext_sqlite_regex ./sqlite3-pcre.so
