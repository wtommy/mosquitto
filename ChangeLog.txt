0.6 - 2010xxxx
==============

- Experimental support for connecting multiple MQTT brokers togethers
  (bridging).
- mosquitto_sub can now subscribe to multiple topics (limited to a global QoS).
- mosquitto_pub can now send a file as a message.
- mosquitto_pub can now read all of stdin and send it as a message.
- mosquitto_pub can now read stdin and send each line as a message.
- mosquitto will now run VACUUM on the persistent database on exit, instead of
  the in-memory database.
- Implement a more efficient database design, so that only one copy of each
  message is held in the database, rather than one per subscribed client.
- Add the store_cleanup_interval config option for dealing with the internal
  message store.
- Add support for disabling "clean session" for the sub client.
- Add support for automatic upgrading of the mosquitto DB from v1 to v2.
- Add persistence_file config option to allow changing the filename of the
  persistence database. This allows multiple mosquitto DBs to be stored in the
  same location whilst keeping persistence_location compatible with rsmb.
- Don't store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients. Fixes bug #572608. This
  wasn't correctly fixed in version 0.5.
- Don't disconnect clients if they send a PUBLISH with zero length payload
  (bug #573610).
- If a retained message is received with a zero length payload, the retained
  message for that topic is deleted - messages of zero length never get sent
  on to other clients.
- Produce a warning on unsupported rsmb options instead of quitting.
- Describe clean session flag in the mqtt man page.
- Implement the max_inflight_messages and max_queued_messages features in the
  broker.

0.5.4 - 20100311
================

- Fix memory allocation in mqtt3_fix_sub_topic() (bug #531861).
- Remove accidental limit of 100 client connections.
- Fix mosquitto_pub handling of messages with QoS>0 (bug #537061).

0.5.3 - 20100303
================

- Will messages are now only sent when a client disconnects unexpectedly.
- Fix all incoming topics/subscriptions that start with a / or contain
  multiple / in a row (//).
- Do actually disconnect client when it sends an empty subscription/topic string.
- Add missing $SYS/broker/clients/total to man page.

0.5.2 - 20100302
================

- Always update last backup time, so that the backup doesn't run every time
  through the main loop once autosave_interval has been reached.
- Report $SYS/broker/uptime in the same format as rsmb.
- Make mandatory options obvious in usage output and man page of mosquitto_pub.
  Fixes bug #529990.
- Treat subscriptions with a trailing slash correctly. This should fix bugs
  #530369 and #530099.
  
0.5.1 - 20100227
================

- Must daemonise before pid file is written.

0.5 - 20100227
==============

- No longer store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients that do not have
  clean start set.
- Rename msg_timeout option to retry_interval for better rsmb compatibility.
- Change persistence behaviour. The database is now stored in memory even if
  persistence is enabled. It is written to disk when mosquitto exits and also at
  periodic intervals as defined by the new autosave_interval option.
- The writing of the persistence database may be forced by sending mosquitto
  the SIGUSR1 signal.
- Clients that do not send CONNECT as their first command are now
  disconnected.
- Boolean configuration values may now be specified with true/false as well as
  1/0.
- Log message on CONNECT with invalid protocol or protocol version.
- Default sqlite3-pcre path on Linux is now /usr/lib/sqlite3/pcre.so to match
  future sqlite3-pcre packages.
- Add mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_pub, simple clients for subscribe/publish.
- Add man pages for clients.
- Add general man page on mqtt.
- Root privileges are now dropped only after attempting to write a pid file
  (if configured). This means that the pid file can be written to /var/run/
  directly and should fix bug #523183.

0.4.2 - 20100203
================

- Fix segfault on client connect with invalid protocol name/version.

0.4.1 - 20100112
===============

- Fix regex used for finding retained messages to send on new subscription.

0.4 - 20100105
==============

- Added support for wildcard subscriptions using + and #.
- All network operations are now non-blocking and can cope with partial
  packets, meaning that networking should be a lot more reliable.
- Total messsages/bytes sent/received are now available in $SYS.
- Improved logging information - use client ip address and id instead of
  socket number.
- Broker build timestamp is available in $SYS.
- Keepalive==0 is now correctly treated as "never disconnect".
- Fixed manpage installation.
- Fixed incorrect $SYS hierarchy locations in documentation and code.
- Debug type log messages are no longer sent to "topics".
- Default logging destination no longer includes "topics" to prevent possible
  error logging to the db before it is initialised.
- Periodic $SYS messages can now be disabled.
- stdout and stderr are flushed when logging to them to give more timely
  updates.
- dup is now set correctly when resending messages.
- Database format bumped due to topic column naming fix.

0.3 - 20091217
==============

- The port option in the configuration file and --port command line argument
  may now be given any number of times to make mosquitto listen on multiple
  sockets.
- Add new config file and command line option "interface" to specify an
  interface to listen on, rather than all interfaces.
- Added host access control through tcp-wrappers support.
- Set SO_REUSEADDR on the listening socket so restart is much quicker.
- Added support for tracking current heap memory usage - this is published on
  the topic "$SYS/broker/heap/current size"
- Added code for logging to stderr, stdout, syslog and topics. 
- Added logging to numerous places - still plenty of scope for more.

0.2 - 20091204
==============

- Replaced the command line option --foreground with --daemon, swapping the
  default behaviour.
- Added the command line option --config-file, to specify a config file to
  load.  If this is not given, no config file is load and the default options
  are used.
- Added the command line option --port for specifying the port to listen on.
  This overrides values in the config file.
- Don't use persistence by default.
- Default behaviour is now more sane when run by a normal user with no command
  line options (combination of above changes).
- Added option user to config file, defaulting to a value of mosquitto. If
  this value isn't blank and mosquitto is started by root, then it will drop
  privileges by changing to the user and its primary group. This replaces the
  current behaviour of refusing to start if run by root.
- Fix non-persistent mode, which would never work in the previous release.
- Added information on default values of msg_timeout and sys_interval to the
  mosquitto.conf man page. (closes bug #492045).
